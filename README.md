# Steel Manufacturing Sales Prediction Project

## Introduction
Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Steel Manufacturing Sales Prediction competition. This project was an exciting opportunity to apply my skills in machine learning and data science to predict quarterly sales for a steel manufacturing company's diverse customer base. This challenge combined real-world business data with economic indicators, providing a comprehensive dataset to work with.

As a participant, my goal was to develop a predictive model that could accurately forecast sales figures using both company-specific data and general economic conditions available in the datasets provided. The competition required not only a keen understanding of machine learning techniques but also an ability to handle and interpret complex data structures.

## Data Overview
The datasets provided during the competition included:
- `train.csv`: Contained detailed historical sales data for each of the company's 75 customers.
- `test.csv`: Similar to `train.csv` but required to predict the quarterly sales for these customers.
- `EconomicIndicators.csv`: Featured various economic indicators on a monthly basis, which were crucial for understanding external factors affecting sales.

These datasets were pivotal in building my model, as they included a mix of synthetic and real data tailored to mimic the challenges faced by data scientists in the industry.

## Model Development and Evaluation
My approach to the competition involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and experimenting with various machine learning models. The primary evaluation metric was the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), which measured the average magnitude of the errors in the predictions without considering their direction.

## Submission and Learning
The final submission involved predicting sales figures for the given quarter for each customer and submitting these predictions in a specified format. This project not only enhanced my analytical skills but also deepened my understanding of how machine learning can be applied in business contexts.

## Repository Contents
This repository contains all the scripts, notebooks, and analysis that I developed as part of this competition. I have also included a detailed Jupyter Notebook that walks through my analysis and the thought process behind my modeling choices.
